# 📊 Community Vaccination Rate Analytics of India using QGIS

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to analyze and visualize vaccination rates and disease burden across India, with a particular focus on South India. The primary aim is to address geographic disparities in immunization and improve early disease detection and intervention strategies. By using QGIS, we created dynamic choropleth maps and spatial data visualizations to highlight areas at higher risk of communicable diseases.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize and analyze spatial trends in vaccination coverage.
- Identify geographic disparities in healthcare access.
- Integrate demographic and health data into QGIS.
- Map high-risk disease zones and predict potential outbreak areas.
- Develop data dashboards for real-time public health monitoring.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Vaccination data from NFHS, IDSP  
   - Geospatial data from GADM shapefiles

2. **QGIS Processing Pipeline**  
   - Load spatial and attribute data  
   - Join datasets based on district/county identifiers  
   - Create choropleth symbology  
   - Add map labels and annotations  
   - Export GIS outputs for visualization and analysis

## 🗺️ GIS Outputs & Insights

- **Choropleth maps** visualizing immunization coverage at district level.
- **Heatmaps** of disease incidence to identify vulnerable regions.
- **Vector layer analysis** revealing overlaps between health burden and environmental risks.

### 💡 Key Insights:
- Rural districts exhibited significantly lower immunization rates.
- Correlation found between urban slums and outbreaks like dengue.
- Maps help inform targeted intervention zones and policy planning.

## 🚧 Challenges Encountered
- Incomplete or outdated district-level health data.
- Difficulty accessing real-time surveillance feeds.
- Steep learning curve in using QGIS and geostatistical tools.
- Integration of diverse datasets with varying formats and resolution.

---

## 🔮 Future Directions
- Incorporate real-time data using mHealth and IoT devices.
- Use machine learning models to forecast disease outbreaks.
- Expand coverage to all Indian states and union territories.
- Add a public feedback loop via community app interface.

---

## ✅ Outcomes
- Developed an interactive GIS-based visualization platform for vaccination analytics.
- Enabled health decision-makers to view immunization trends by region.
- Highlighted the need for centralized, up-to-date health data systems.
- Reinforced GIS as a powerful tool for population health and epidemiology.
